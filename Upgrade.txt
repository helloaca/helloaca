Let's work on the pricing model...

There should be multiple options, 
- Pay-per-use
- Pro
- Team
- Business
- Enterprise

The pay-as-you-go option will use the same format, where users can buy credits and use them per contract ($7 for 1 credit, $30 for 5 credits, $55 for 10 credits, and the custom credit where the user can choose how much credit to buy)... When users click on this plan, the options should pop-up

Then, for the subscription option, they pay $24/month, then they get 5 credits per month, their unused credits get rolled over (up to 10 max), they get all the pro features (Full analysis, chat, negotiation playbook, personal library, PDF export) when users click on this option they should be able to select if to pay per year/Annually or per month/monthly

Then, for the enterprise/business/team model, users with this model will get a modified dashboard different from the current dashboard (normal users)... The reason is to be able to make sure the Enterprise users can make use of all these features listed below...

Business Tier Pricing & Reasoning
Tier 1: Team — $79/month
What's Included:
5 seats
30 contract analyses/month (team-wide pool)
Shared contract library
Team dashboard with analytics
Centralized billing
Email support (48-hour response)
Additional seats: $12/seat/month
Additional contract packs: 10 contracts for $40 (if they exceed 30)

Pricing Rationale:
Why $79/month?
Cost Analysis:
30 contracts × $0.50 = $15 in costs
Support overhead: ~$10/month per customer (amortized)
Total cost: $25/month
Margin: $54/month (68%)

Value-Based Pricing:
Alternative: Hire a paralegal to review 30 contracts = $1,500-3,000
Alternative: 30 individual pay-as-you-go purchases = $210 (at $7 each)
Your price: $79 = 63% savings vs. pay-as-you-go
Your price: $79 = 95% savings vs. paralegal

Competitive Benchmarking:
Contract management tools (ContractWorks, Ironclad): $200-500/month
Team productivity tools (Notion, Asana): $10-15/user = $50-75 for 5 users
Your pricing slots below enterprise tools, above productivity tools ✓


Customer Psychology:
$79/month = $2.63/day for entire team
Single bad contract costs agency $5K-50K
ROI is obvious: "Pays for itself if it prevents ONE mistake."

Seat Economics:
5 seats included = natural fit for 5-10 person agency
Want more? Pay $12/seat (still cheaper than they'd pay individually at $24/month Pro)
Expansion revenue built in

Target Customer:

5-15 person creative/consulting agencies
Review 20-40 client contracts per month
No in-house legal counsel
Annual revenue: $500K-2M

Upsell Path:
Pro user says: "Can I share this with my business partner?"
Prompt: "Upgrade to Team for $79/month — add 4 more teammates + shared library."

Additional seats: $10/seat/month
Additional contract packs: 25 contracts for $75 (if they exceed 100)

Pricing Rationale:
Why $199/month?
Cost Analysis:
100 contracts × $0.50 = $50 in costs
Priority support: ~$30/month per customer
White-label infrastructure: ~$10/month
Total cost: $90/month
Margin: $109/month (55%)

Value-Based Pricing:

Alternative: Paralegal review = $5,000-10,000
Your price: $199 = 72% savings vs. pay-as-you-go
Your price: $199 = 98% savings vs. paralegal

Feature Value:
Approval workflows alone are worth $50/month (prevents unauthorized contracts)
White-label reports worth $50/month (they can charge clients for "contract review service")
Analytics worth $30/month (spot patterns, reduce risk)
Total feature value: $130/month
Your price: $199 = features + analysis

Competitive Benchmarking:
Workflow tools (Asana Business, Monday.com): $12-20/user = $180-300 for 15 users
Contract software (PandaDoc, Ironclad): $300-600/month
You're positioned below enterprise contract tools, competitive with workflow tools ✓

ROI Calculation:
Agency bills $150/hour average
Manual contract review: 2 hours/contract
100 contracts = 200 hours = $30,000 in billable time lost
Your tool saves: $30,000 - (100 × 0.5 hours × $150) = $22,500/month in time
Your price: $199 = 0.88% of time savings

Target Customer:
15-40 person agencies/firms
Review 80-150 contracts per month
Have formal approval processes
Want to offer contract review as a client service (white-label)

Dedicated support: ~$100/month per customer (account manager time)
Infrastructure (SSO, API, compliance): ~$50/month
Total cost: $400/month
Margin: $99/month (20%) — Lower margin, but acceptable for enterprise

Alternative: In-house legal team = $120K-200K/year = $10K-17K/month
Alternative: Contract management enterprise software = $1,000-5,000/month
Your price: $499 = 90% savings vs. legal team, 50-80% vs. enterprise software

Enterprise Buyer Psychology:
$499/month = $5,988/year
Enterprise budgets think in "seats" and "per employee cost."
50 employees = $9.98/employee/month = trivial per-head cost
"Is this worth $10/person to reduce contract risk?" = instant yes

Custom Features Justify Premium:
SSO alone costs $50-100/month from other SaaS tools
API access typically $200-500/month as an add-on
Dedicated account manager = $1,500+/month value
You're bundling $750+/month in enterprise features for $499

Annual Contract Value (ACV):
$499/month × 12 = $5,988 ACV
This crosses the threshold where:
Sales calls are worth it
Custom contracts make sense
You can afford dedicated support
It's a "real" enterprise deal

Target Customer:

50+ person agencies, law firms, consulting firms
SaaS companies (legal team reviewing vendor/customer contracts)
Staffing agencies are placing hundreds of contractors
